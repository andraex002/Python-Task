Python Task

What I created is a Python App which add, remove or compute the bonus salary of an employee. The values and the changes generated via Python App can be seen in the Database that I created via PHP-SQL Code. The Code for the Python App and also for the Database is loaded.
The server is localhost and running via XAMPP and PHP-MyAdmin. ( When wanted to create a database with PHP like this the .php files should be saved in the XAMPP- htdocs folder, because otherwise, it will not work.)
